<p>A technical test submission by <a href="https://github.com/Bodacious">Gavin Morrice</a>.</p>

<h2 id="install-the-gems">Install the gems</h2>

<p>Make sure you have all of the dependencies required by running <code>bundle install</code>.</p>

<p>The app is built using Ruby 2.7.2, and the Gemfile expects this version of Ruby.</p>

<h2 id="setup-the-database">Setup the database</h2>

<p>To get started, run <code>rails db:setup</code>. This will create a local dev and test database (sqlite3) and seed the database with two <code>StoredPostcode</code> records.</p>

<h2 id="run-the-app">Run the app</h2>

<p>This is a typical Rails 6.1 setup, with the unused libraries removed. You can run the server locally with <code>rails server</code>.</p>

<p>Type in a value to the form field and click “Search” to find out if a postcode is within the service area.</p>

<h2 id="run-the-tests">Run the tests</h2>

<p>The code is tested using RSpec. To run the tests, use <code>rspec spec</code>. Please note the <em>gotcha</em> concerning Webmock.</p>

<h2 id="create-documentation">Create documentation</h2>

<p>This README and the documentation for the app can be viewed in a more readable format by running:</p>

<p><code>
yard doc --plugin tomdoc --hide-void-return --title "Postcode Search" --markup=markdown --markup-provider=kramdown --readme=README.md
</code></p>

<p>The above command will create HTML at <code>doc/index.html</code> which you can view in your browser.</p>

<p>The code is documented using the <a href="https://tomdoc.org">TomDoc format</a></p>

<h3 id="postcodes-io-gem">Postcodes IO Gem</h3>

<p>I noticed there’s already a <a href="https://github.com/jamesruston/postcodes_io">postcodes IO gem</a>. In a real-world setting, I would probably have opted for that, assuming it still works well. I felt that using that in this case would have missed the point of the technical assessment, so I coded my own solution.</p>

<h3 id="repository-pattern">Repository pattern</h3>

<p>The brief describes two separate places in which to search for data relating to a single search. I approached this problem by injecting these two <em>repositories</em> into the search service object as a parameter (See PostcodeFinder). This made it easier to test in isolation, while also providing a scalable design pattern for adding future data repositories (which might include a cache store or alternative remote service).</p>

<h3 id="postcode-object">Postcode object</h3>

<p>I defined a Postcode class in the base lib directory as a single source of truth for <em>postcodes</em> within the system. I felt this approach would be easier to maintain as the system grows and future requirements change. I opted for a <code>Object.parse</code> pattern, since it’s a commonly used ruby idiom, and provides out-of-the box compatibility with various libraries (e.g. the Grape API library).</p>

<h3 id="storedpostcode">StoredPostcode</h3>

<p>The brief states that specific unrecognised postcodes, or specific postcodes outside of the service areas should still be supported by the system. The StoredPostcode model is a simple, local data store that provides this functionality. Records must have a valid UK postcode format, but can have any LSOA—which can be used to cater to postcodes whose real LSOA is outside the service area.</p>

<p>Local storage is searched before the postcodes.io database so that LSOA values can be overwritten if desired (i.e. to support a postcode outside the service area).</p>

<h3 id="serviceablearea">ServiceableArea</h3>

<p>It seemed like overkill to create a database table and model for ServiceableArea when there are really only two qualifying cases. But I extracted this concept out into a logical place so that it can easily be extended with a database etc. in future if the requirements change.</p>

<h3 id="webmock">WebMock</h3>

<p>Webmock, annoyingly, will try to update driver versions while you run your tests. If you’re also blocking external requests (which I do in this app) then this is blocked and will result in a confusing error about Chrome or Mozilla. To fix this, comment out the <code>WebMock.disable_net_connect!(allow_localhost: true)</code> and uncomment the line below <code>WebMock.allow_net_connect!</code> then run the tests again. Once the drivers have been updated, remember to switch those configurations back to the way they were.</p>
